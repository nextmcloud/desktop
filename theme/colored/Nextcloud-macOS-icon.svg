        Purpose Statement

        This SVG document is set up with human-readable
        definitions and instances so that the markup
        can easily be tweaked or have the logo and/or
        squircle replaced with other shapes. If you
        import this SVG document into Illustrator, it
        will probably come out unrecognizable if it
        even works at all.

        I've added inline comments explaining almost
        every single SVG entity in this document
        in order to make it easier to understand.

        Aside from the Nextcloud logo (which is
        a registered trademark), I (Elsie Hupp) am
        personally releasing the rest of this document
        under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication, though
        if it has been further edited by anyone
        at (for example) Nextcloud, it may have been
        re-licensed under the Affero GNU Public License
        or another similarly restrictive license.

        If you'd like a fully CC0 license-cleared copy
        of this document, or if you have any questions
        about how the document is set up, feel free
        to email me.

        Basic Organization

        - CSS values are at the top of this document.
        - Object intantiations are in the middle.
        - SVG definitions are at the bottom.

        Replacing Shapes

        To replace the logo, create a new path
        called "logo-path" under <defs>. (There is
        a skeleton definition to help you get started.)
        Next, uncomment the "logo-path" instances
        in "logo-include-mask" and "logo-occlude-mask".
        Then, finally, remove the circles defining
        the Nextcloud logo. You should be able to
        adjust the scale in the CSS.

        To replace the squircle with a different
        shape for a platform other than macOS, scroll
        down to <defs> and replace the contents
        of "squircle-path". (There are examples
        of a circle and a rounded rectangle to
        help you get started.)

        Changing Colors

        All of the colors are defined in the CSS.
        The only colors you'll likely want to change
        are the gradient top color and the gradient
        bottom color. If you do change the logo fill
        color to something darker, though, you may
        want to change the logo top-edge inner shadow
        to an inner glow for better contrast.

        Limitations

        If you want to use a logo that isn't based
        on a flat mask, you'll have to figure a lot
        more things out yourself. That said, if
        you're doing so you'll probably have a better
        idea what you're doing here to begin with.

                The reason for the grouping is so that

                The reason the macOS "squircle" is a bézier
