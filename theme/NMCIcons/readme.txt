These files were used to generate an .rcc file. Use the nmctheme.qrc.in file to generate the .qrc file. You could copy paste the content from nmctheme.qrc.in to theme.qrc.in and rerun cmake in your IDE or whereever, then use theme.qrc to generate an .rcc file. After the job is done, restore the theme.qrc.in file and rerun cmake again, so the original theme.qrc is restored, or use git to restore the files.
